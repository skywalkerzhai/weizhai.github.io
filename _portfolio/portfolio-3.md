Rebuilding communities requires an actionable approach to explicitly translate the concept of resilience into postdisaster recovery planning. Through clustering analysis using project titles and project summary, 940 resilience projects are grouped into infrastructure prototypes, economic development prototypes, housing prototypes, and environmental prototypes among the Hurricane Matthew Resilient Redevelopment Plans. This research evaluated the characteristics of all prototypes based on the robustness-rapidity-inclusiveness framework. It also assessed the economic and environmental impacts, community involvement, and governance of identified prototypes. By posing a series of questions for practitioners, this research is a starting point for practitioners to build resilience in postdisaster recovery planning.
