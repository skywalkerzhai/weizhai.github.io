* Paper 1: [Beyond Word2vec: An approach for urban functional region extraction and identification by combining Place2vec and POIs](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.11.008)

  * The actual functions of a region may not reflect the intent of the original zoning scheme from planners. To identify the actual urban functional regions, numerous methods have been proposed with computational advancement. Specifically, remote sensing by image recognition, geodemographic classification, social sensing with big data and geo-text mining techniques have been widely applied. Points-of-interest (POIs) are one of the most common open-access data type used to extract information pertaining to functional zones. However, previous works have either lost sight or did not make full use of the spatial interactions that can be extracted from POIs due to model limitations in the context of geographical space. In this research, we introduced an approach that detects functional regions at the scale of a neighborhood area (NA) by combining POI data and a simplified Place2vec model, which is theorized from the first law of geography.

* Paper 2: [From edit distance to augmented space-time-weighted edit distance: Detecting and clustering patterns of human activities in Puget Sound region](10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2019.05.003)
  * Considering and measuring the similarity of human activities remains challenging. Existing studies of similarity measures based on traditional edit distance (ED), specifically on activity patterns, do not reflect the spatiotemporal characteristics in the measurement model. Additionally, interdependence between activities is ignored in existing multidimensional sequence alignment methods. To address the gap, we initially extend the traditional edit distance to a space-time-weighted edit distance (STW-ED). Specifically, differences in distance and time between activities are considered cost functions in the operation cost calculation (insertion, deletion, and substitution). We advance STW-ED to an augmented space-time-weighted edit distance method (ASTW-ED)that integrates an optimum-trajectory-based multidimensional sequence alignment method (OT-MDSAM)with STW-ED, treating the nonspatiotemporal dimensions as augment factors. In addition, ontology is considered for the similarity measure for nonspatiotemporal dimensions.

* Paper 3: [Social media for enhanced understanding of disaster resilience during Hurricane Florence](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102289)

  * Citizens with different demographic characters presented varying responses and behaviors in the same disasters. Their divergent responses can impact their actual damages during crises. Previous studies have employed social media for analyzing citizens’ crisis responses. However, these studies missed the demographic dimension. To resolve this limitation, this research proposes three objectives: 1) to explore the variances of sentiment polarities among different racial/ethnic and gender groups; 2) to investigate the concern themes in their expressions, including theme popularity and their sentiment towards these themes; 3) to enhance the understanding of social aspects of disaster resilience with the results of disaster response disparities. Results indicate that Hispanic and male groups are more likely to express negative sentiment. The black group pays the least attention to ‘hurricane warn’ and shows most interests in ‘pray/donate’. The white group is most optimistic about hurricane/flood impacts while the black group shows dissatisfaction towards ‘response’. The female group pays less attention to ‘hurricane warn’ while they are more optimistic towards ‘hurricane/flood impact’ and ‘response’ than the male group.
