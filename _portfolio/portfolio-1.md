* Paper 1: [Damage assessment using Google Street View: Evidence from Hurricane Michael in Mexico Beach, Florida](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102252)

  * Assessing damage on the ground is a challenging task for humanitarian organizations and disaster managers due to the limited availability of data and methods for processing. As the most commonly adopted data source, remote sensing imagery can only reflect the damage situation on top of a building and fails to present the damage level from the perspective of the human eye. Recently, an increasing number of Google Street View (GSV) images provide the chance to understand the human's perception of damage on the ground. However, to automatically and quantitatively apply GSV images in damage assessment, two research questions need to be answered: (1) Can deep learning be successfully applied to automate the process of evaluating postdisaster damage using GSV images? (2) Does damage assessment using GSV images provide a different insight, compared with existing approaches, such as remote sensing imagery?

* Paper 2: [Examine the effects of neighborhood equity on disaster situational awareness: Harness machine learning and geotagged Twitter data](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101611)
  * A disaster-resilient city should address social inequity in all its forms. Complete, accurate, and up-to-the-minute situational awareness (SA) can help disaster relief organizations stabilize the dangers and prevent further losses in poor and ethnic minority neighborhoods. However, the lapse of months or years of survey data could lead to biases since retrospective studies are affected by the emotional status at the time of the survey. To address this, we aim to examine the effects of neighborhood equity on SA in a hurricane event using geotagged Twitter data. We adopted the sentiment analysis, convolutional neural network (CNN) model and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model to reflect SA in Hurricane Florence. The multinomial logit regression model reveals that the tweet originated from a poor neighborhood has a higher probability of being more negative, compared to being neutral. Also, we surprisingly found that the sentiment of a tweet in a black neighborhood could be less likely to be negative. Another novel finding is that black neighborhoods could discuss the hurricane with a positive attitude while poor neighborhoods are more concerned about the work during the hurricane. This study shows that, by incorporating with aggregated sociodemographic data, geotagged Twitter data can also be used to understand disaster SA from the perspective of social equity.

* Paper 3: [Social media for enhanced understanding of disaster resilience during Hurricane Florence](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102289)

  * Citizens with different demographic characters presented varying responses and behaviors in the same disasters. Their divergent responses can impact their actual damages during crises. Previous studies have employed social media for analyzing citizens’ crisis responses. However, these studies missed the demographic dimension. To resolve this limitation, this research proposes three objectives: 1) to explore the variances of sentiment polarities among different racial/ethnic and gender groups; 2) to investigate the concern themes in their expressions, including theme popularity and their sentiment towards these themes; 3) to enhance the understanding of social aspects of disaster resilience with the results of disaster response disparities. Results indicate that Hispanic and male groups are more likely to express negative sentiment. The black group pays the least attention to ‘hurricane warn’ and shows most interests in ‘pray/donate’. The white group is most optimistic about hurricane/flood impacts while the black group shows dissatisfaction towards ‘response’. The female group pays less attention to ‘hurricane warn’ while they are more optimistic towards ‘hurricane/flood impact’ and ‘response’ than the male group.
