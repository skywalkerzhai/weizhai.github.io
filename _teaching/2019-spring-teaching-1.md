This course introduces students to the field of urban planning. Firstly, this course approaches urban planning by historical analysis. We, therefore, first, study how cities across the world grew and developed since the industrial revolution. Based on this preliminary understanding, we proceed to take stock of the various theories built to understand urban planning practices. Secondly, this course touches upon the urban problems facing urban planners, such as gentrification, urban decline, congestion, etc. The third part explores the basic ethical, legal, scientific, and economic principles that underlie environmental planning. Planning strategies are examined as a vehicle for understanding the intent and scope of current environmental policy.
