This is an Experiential-learning course. This course provides experiential learning opportunities for students to apply their knowledge and skills to tackle complex real-life problems via developing and organising field studies. Students will identify environmental or social issues for their field studies, in which they can engage the communities to obtain first-hand materials and feedback for their investigating issues. Students will have the opportunities to apply their interdisciplinary knowledge for designing a field trip study to investigate/research these issues.
